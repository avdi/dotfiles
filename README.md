# Prerequisites

AKA stuff I couldn't automate. Yet.

## Windows

- Install PowerShell Core: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases
- Enable local script execution:
  ```PowerShell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
  ```
- Run .\install.ps1 in PowerShell Core

# Notes on Apps

## VS Code

I'm currently synchronizing VS Code via this extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync

NOT in the dotfiles repo.
